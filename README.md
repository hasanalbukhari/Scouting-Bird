# Scouting-Bird
iOS app that shows places around you and allows you to check their website and make them a call.

# iOS 10
Tested on iOS 9 device.

Not fully tested against iOS 10. Since I don't have an iOS 10 device and the simulator doesn't allow the Location Service capability.

I don't Believe that this will cause any problems. I just wanted to point that out.
